In this directory are a few sorting algorithm implementations that I have created in Java.

Each program can be called in one of the following 2 ways:
	java ____Sort [x1] [x2] [x3] [x4] ...
	java ____Sort [filename.txt]

"nums.txt" is included as an example
	each # is on a new line

Prints the #s in sorted order from least to greatest
