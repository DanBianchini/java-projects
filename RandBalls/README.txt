In Bingo, there are 75 balls total.
Each ball has a unique number (1-75), so there can be no repeats.

This program is called as follows:
	java RandBalls [# of calls]

A file will be generated in the same directory as RandBalls.class called "balls.txt"
This file will have the # of lines you specified (each line is one ball call)
Each ball call is randomly generated
